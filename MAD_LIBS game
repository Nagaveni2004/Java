Today, I went to the zoo with my best friend,Cheseball.
First, we saw a fabulous giraffe jumping up and down in its tree.It burped so loudly, we had to moonwalk away!
Next, we fed a suspicious panda some glittery donuts.
It loved them so much, it started breakdancing.
Then we watched a zookeeper teach a penguin to juggle.
It was so awkward ,I almost dropped my toasterOn the way out, I bought a sparkly hat shaped like a narwhal.
What a legendary day at the zoo!
